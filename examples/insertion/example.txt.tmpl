For fairly complex and/or automated scenarios, insertions can also be done via directives or specialized comments found within a proto file.
For example. The message below was generated by an annotation in the `insertion.proto` file

// @@protoc_insertion_point(example_insert)

Also, multiple insertions can be made via different annotations
// @@protoc_insertion_point(example_insert2)

Below is an example of a multi-line insertion
