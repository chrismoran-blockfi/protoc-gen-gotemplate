For fairly complex and/or automated scenarios, insertions can also be done via directives or specialized comments found within a proto file.
For example. The message below was generated by an annotation in the `insertion.proto` file

i was inserted via proto-file directive for the DummyService!
// @@protoc_insertion_point(example_insert)

Also, multiple insertions can be made via different annotations
I am from an annotation above "DummyMessage"
// @@protoc_insertion_point(example_insert2)

Below is an example of a multi-line insertion

Multiple lines can also be inserted
for more complicated scenarios
// @@protoc_insertion_point(example_multi_insert)
